    <p>The 2025 Audi RS 7 is a midsize luxury car morphed into a 621-horsepower rocket. Pricing starts at $129,895.
        Despite not opting for the carbon-ceramic brakes, which allow its top speed to be increased from 155 to 190 mph, the standard stoppers hauled this nearly 5000-pound four-door down from 70 mph in an impressive 151 feet in our testing.
